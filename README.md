A simple Python script that scrapes a webiste with various books and exports the data  into a csv files that contains the name of the book, rthe price and  the 
rating that the book has gotten out of 5.
In terms of the libraries used, we use **BeautifulSoup**, a python package to parse the HTML that we  fetch from the wwebsite, the beneift of this library compared 
to others would be its capabilities to work even with some malformed markup.
Other than that we use **Pandas** to  get the data into a DataFrame and export it to a csv, which can be used to furthur build visualizations or help decide what book
you want to buy without all the hastle of market reasearch and adds and signing up to online websites.
